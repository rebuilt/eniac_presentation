"And we took the string and band devices out of the
integrator and put in the electric motors, gears, and photocells, and a variety of other things. (They originally had
students down there building pointers, putting arbitrary functions into the machine and we got rid of those and put
in devices that followed curves drawn on pieces of paper with photocell motors.) By the time we got done, I had to
put in a couple of hundred tubes into the otherwise mechanical machine. Not only a couple of hundred tubes but 13
amplidynes and 15 to 20 servomotors and a bunch of photocells and various other power supplies and contraptions.
So the machine was no longer a mechanical machine
The original machine could have been driven with a steam
engine, it was just mechanical, you just had to turn it with a couple of motors; actually there was a motor for each
integrator--18 motors to be exact. But it could have been 13 steam engines just as well. So, by now it really was an
electro-mechanical device, though still analog. The improvement however was pretty exciting--the speed was about
10 times and the accuracy about 10 times. The individual integrators were accurate to 100 to 1 percent--which is
pretty accurate for an analog device. In fact to get beyond that, you had to air condition the room better. To go
beyond that with analog devices, we were already grinding parts down to 50 millionths of an inch or so in integrator
wheels. We decided it would be an error to get another factor of 10 to improve speed of accuracy, a Herculean error
which we probably would still be at if we had chosen that road."

So, the ENIAC is a peculiar machine and it's the only
machine that we ever built that didn't have centralized programming. It had what I would call a distributed
programming system--which I would have later called local control (which has later been called local control and
many of the original patents are written for this principle of local control and nobody could use it much in later
machines).

## Claude Shannon
A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits
* Diagramed switching circuits that could implement the essential operators of Boolean algebra
* He proved that his switching circuits could be used to simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays
* He proved that these circuits could solve all problems that Boolean algebra could solve.
* He presented diagrams of several circuits, including a digital 4-bit full adder.

## Von Neumann
 First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC
Von Neumann describes a detailed design of a "very high speed automatic digital computing system." He divides it into six major subdivisions: a central arithmetic part, CA; a central control part, CC; memory, M; input, I; output, O; and (slow) external memory, R, such as punched cards, Teletype tape, or magnetic wire or steel tape.
Binary
avoiding any attempt at improving performance by overlapping operations
synchronous with a master system clock

ENIAC combined full, Turing-complete programmability with electronic speed


## Successful Programming
* fundamental understanding of the hardware
* Pair programming
* Teamwork
* Inventing pedaling sheets for understanding program flow in an asyncronous system
* Testing (both unit and system tests) (verify correct operation of the machine and their program)
