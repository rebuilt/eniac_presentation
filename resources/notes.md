# Cost
Original 61,000 then 500,000.  More than 7 million.

# Using existing technology
Electricity is not digital.  Vaccuum tubes have a range of operation

## Number of tubes
  * Original 5000 tubes then 18000 tubes

## Vaccuum tube reliability
  * Run the tubes with lower voltage  
  * Limit the amount of power cycling
## IBM card readers/punches

## Decimal
* Digits

## Modules
* Initiating unit
* Cycling unit
* Master Programmer
* Accumulator (20)
* Divider/Square rooter -  35 per second
* Multiplier - 357 multiplications per second
* 3 moveable function tables
* Card reader
* Card punch

## Characteristics
No language.  Programmed with wires and switches
Accumulators are the only memory
No separation between storage and computation
parallel
Dataflow architecture

## Hydrogen Bomb

## Monte Carlo Method

## No programming manuals
* Pair programming
* Learn from circuit/logic/panel diagrams

## Debugging



## Artillary program

## Von Neumann
 First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC
Von Neumann describes a detailed design of a "very high speed automatic digital computing system." He divides it into six major subdivisions: a central arithmetic part, CA; a central control part, CC; memory, M; input, I; output, O; and (slow) external memory, R, such as punched cards, Teletype tape, or magnetic wire or steel tape.
Binary
avoiding any attempt at improving performance by overlapping operations
synchronous with a master system clock

ENIAC combined full, Turing-complete programmability with electronic speed
