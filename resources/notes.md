# Penn Engineers
1954: Women admitted to the undergraduate programs of the School of Engineering

# Cost
Original 61,000 then 500,000.  More than 7 million.

# Using existing technology
Electricity is not digital.  Vaccuum tubes have a range of operation

## Number of tubes
  * Original 5000 tubes then 18000 tubes

## Vaccuum tube reliability
  * Run the tubes with lower voltage  
  * Limit the amount of power cycling

## Industry
* Vaccum Tubes - Raytheon
* IBM card readers/punches

# Science
## George Boole
1848: George Boole. "The Calculus of Logic"
Outlines boolean logic

## Claude Shannon
A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits
* Diagramed switching circuits that could implement the essential operators of Boolean algebra
* He proved that his switching circuits could be used to simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays
* He proved that these circuits could solve all problems that Boolean algebra could solve.
* He presented diagrams of several circuits, including a digital 4-bit full adder.

## Decimal
* Digits

## Modules
* Initiating unit
* Cycling unit
* Master Programmer
* Accumulator (20)
* Divider/Square rooter -  35 per second
* Multiplier - 357 multiplications per second
* 3 moveable function tables
* Card reader
* Card punch

## Characteristics

## Von Neumann
 First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC
Von Neumann describes a detailed design of a "very high speed automatic digital computing system." He divides it into six major subdivisions: a central arithmetic part, CA; a central control part, CC; memory, M; input, I; output, O; and (slow) external memory, R, such as punched cards, Teletype tape, or magnetic wire or steel tape.
Binary
avoiding any attempt at improving performance by overlapping operations
synchronous with a master system clock

ENIAC combined full, Turing-complete programmability with electronic speed
