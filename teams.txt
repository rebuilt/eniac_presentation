Evidence for a collective intelligence factor in the performance of human groups

In two studies with 699 people, working in groups of two to five, we find converging
evidence of a general collective intelligence factor that explains a group’s performance on a wide variety
of tasks. This “c factor” is not strongly correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence
of group members but is correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in
distribution of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the group.
